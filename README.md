# Base Converter

A small tinkering tool I wrote back in 2018 for converting between bases.

It supports up to base 62 (that being 10 numbers + 26 uppercase + 26 lowercase letters), each character has a unique number value which is consistent across all bases.  
Numbers represent 0-9; uppercase letters (A-Z) represent 10-35; and lowercase letters (a-z) represent 36-61.
